## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important? JavaScript Object Notation: it's a lightweight and easy to use way of formatting data
2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord? Joins allows you to specify which attributes you want from the associated table, while includes automatically loads them all.
3. What's an API? Application Program Interface: it's a wrapper that allows users to interact with our data in specified ways, or vice versa
4. How do we test an internal API (in general)? Requests (controllers)
5. What are two different ways to customize your `json`? Serializers and JBuilder
